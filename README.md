The project is build using Android Studio Bumblebee 2021.1.1
Using Android Gradle Plugin 7.1.3
Using Gradle 7.3.3
Using Android Build Tools 30.0.3
Using JDK 11

Note: I did not take the atomic-commit approach with this project although I would've prefered it.

Approach in this project:

MVVM

Clean Code Rules applied

Clean Architecture implemented in a light way

DI - using Hilt

Android Architecture Components



Notes:
No comments, as per Clean Code book written by uncle bob

Core module Acts as a glue between different modules

I didn't use usecases and made the viewmodels communicate directly with the repos for ease of use.
